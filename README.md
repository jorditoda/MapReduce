# MapReduce Project 

This is a simple project example on github using the
[MapReduce](https://github.com/jorditoda/MapReduce) library.

## Installing PyActor

Packages required:

    python, python-dev, python-pip

Install with:

    sudo pip install pyactor

Or download the source by cloning [PyActor](https://github.com/pedrotgn/pyactor)'s
repository and installing with:

    sudo python setup.py install

If you clone the repository, you will also have access to the tests and a folder
full of examples. Just check the github page and the documentation for a detailed
tutorial.

## Tests

Just put your unit tests in the folder of the project in a way they can import
the modules. If you want your tests to have their own folder, then you need to
add your project to the PYTHONPATH in order to import the modules from outside.
You can do that by hand, or by doing a setup.py file for the project.

You have a little example of a test in this project, but you should find
everything you need on the python docs:

[Testing with Python.](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html)
